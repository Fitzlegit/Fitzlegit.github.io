When I decided to begin th is journey back into coding, I honestly had the expectation that it would be similar to riding a bike. What I was met with was a painful but important lesson… 

I’ve learned that you must relearn what you’ve lost and leave behind the baggage of assumptions. The paradigm shift that is demanded as I’ve progressed through programming concepts and eked out an understanding has been incredibly rewarding once the “ah-ha!” moment hits. When looking at the next coding challenge or segment I’ve often found a feeling welling up inside akin to looking at another imposing mountain wondering just how will I get to the top… and with that feeling comes the whispers or even shouts that it would be easier to just stop…

I’ve listened to those whispers before and have found myself taking from the analogy again sitting at the bottom of the mountain… staring upwards and wondering what the view might be like on the other side. We often psych ourselves up at the beginning but when we reach that point where it gets hard or calls for something more than what we’ve put in before, we stop short of our potential. We limit our future self, sentencing ourselves to failure 

I’m realizing a lot more, that the word “bootcamp” wasn’t just for kicks, and that this program challenges the mental toughness and capacity of any participant sticking it out. As the beginning weeks have progressed I can offer this advice to anyone who begins this journey too: if you keep going, you’ll eventually find yourself moving forward without even realizing it... Ask questions, search for answers and refactor back to old lessons. There’s always something new to learn that you might’ve missed. You can still ride a bike, you just have to learn to switch to new gears.
